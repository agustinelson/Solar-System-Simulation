# Solar System Simulation (coding in process )
This repository contains a solar system simulation that allows you to explore the celestial bodies within our solar system. The simulation provides an interactive visualization of the planets' positions, sizes, and orbits .

### Features
- Realistic rendering of the planets and their relative sizes.
- Accurate representations of the planets' orbits and distances from the Sun..
- Information display for each planet, including its name, mass, diameter, and other relevant details.
- Dynamic time simulation to observe the planets' movements over different periods.
